        <p>I am Prem, a first year CSE student (the grind is real). I have tried my hand at every type of art form which I can comprehend and I learnt that I suck at dancing but the other stuff I do fairly well. 
          I can sing, cook, sketch, write and maybe some other stuff (lag raha h na matrimony page ka description). I've been a pop culture enthusiast for the longest time, which started with pitashree k saath baith k Terminator 2 dekhna and since then I've built my taste as much as I can. 
          I enjoy cinema in any form I can experience it and it just moves me a lot. I've been exploring regional cinema, western classics, vintage movies and I just can't stop admiring the beauty of it all. 
          That being said I'm a VERY big superhero fan too (DC over marvel though). I was on the superhero train before MCU became a huge thing, growing up with movies like flashpoint paradox (the animated one) and kick ass. 
          Music taste bhi thik hi h, like I can listen to anything except hip hop or haryanvi stuff (just can't get into it). My musical taste ranges from rafi saab and talah mehmood to Lynyrd skynrd, Red hot chilli peppers. 
          I build small interfaces, learn HTML/CSS, and like themed UI design. This site is an Omnitrix-themed multi-page portfolio demonstrating layouts and CSS-only interactions.</p>
